# Learning Tips

- When watching video on youtube on tutorials or technical topic, I like to set the default speed to 1.25x or 1.5x and then right click press & hold on the video to change it 2x speed temporarily.
- Install [shottr.css](https://shottr.cc/) on your mac, and use `ctrl` + `opt` + `cmd` + `o` to copy text on your screen to clipboard using OCR. Sometimes, youtube videos don't publish their code on the repo, so this can help from time to time.
