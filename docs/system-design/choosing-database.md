# Choosing Database

SQL vs NoSQL: If you need a flexible schema, you need a NoSQL database else go with an SQL database. With SQL database, you need to do database migration when you have significant schema updates.

Document NoSQL vs Graph NoSQL: If you have lots of many-to-many relationships, use a Graph database else goes with a document database.  

These are one factor, there are other perspectives to look at it as well.
