# Intro

## How to scale to millions of users


## Back-of-the-envelope estimation


## Frameworks for system design interview

- Step 1: Understand the problem, establish design scope, list functional and non-functional requirements, and do back-of-the-envelope estimation (3 - 10 mins)
- Step 2: Propose a high-level design and get buy-in (10 - 15 mins)
- Step 3: Design deep dive (10 - 25 mins)
- Step 4: Wrap-up (3 - 5 mins)

### Step 1

#### Functional requirements


#### Non-functional requirements

Think around the 3 pillars when designing data-intensive applications: 

- Reliability (error handling, security)
- Scalability (load, performance, latency, throughput)
- Maintainability (evolvability)
