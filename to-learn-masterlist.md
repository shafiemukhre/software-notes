## System Design Problems
Do overlap problems from System Design Interview book by Alex Xu and and [Grokking Modern System Design Interview (26 hours)](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-modern-system-design-interview-for-engineers-managers). Use [donnemartin/system-design-primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer) for reviewing system design basics. 

Steps: 1. Clarify/understand the problem + list function vs non-function requirement + BotE estimation -> 2. High-Level Design -> 3. Design dive deep -> Wrap up and review.

## Algorithm

- When creating a note, remember to do it like this: https://ryanzhang.info/ctci/topics/python.html and this https://ryanzhang.info/machine_learning/nlp.html, one-page note but long. The goal is to keep on adding new information but as time goes on, keep on rewriting and make sure only the most important notes are there. Expand and shrink it.
