The first blog entry for this software notes the website.

The main idea of this website is to write everything I learn every day instead of writing it in Notion, kinda like a second brain for all notes related to software. I hope that by writing and publishing my notes (instead of just writing notes randomly in the notion app or Google Docs), I will be able to solidify my understanding and thoughts in a better structure.

I hypothesize that the act of publishing to a public website instead of writing in your private notes will give you some sense of responsibility to write better and some sense of contribution to the vast sea of the internet. So, even though I know I will be the only one using this website as my reference, the act of publishing to a public website itself might be a fulfilling task.
