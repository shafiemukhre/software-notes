# Using Obsidian for blogging

Recently I have been taking software engineering notes directly on my software notes website built with Docusaurus and I like it. Since I'm treating it like a regular note-taking app, I write notes over there as much as I write notes on my local notion file, but now it's public. 

I have been using VS Code IDE with [Office Viewer(Markdown Editor)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cweijan.vscode-office) extension to write markdown files and it's not bad, it has the WYISWYG experience and it works.

I have tried Roam Research previously and I don't like it. I am under the impression that I might not like Obsidian as well since it's an alternative to Roam Research. I came across Karpathy's tweet and reply from the Obsidian founder. I resonate highly with Karpathy request for an ideal blogging platform and I want the same thing too.

Talking points
- First impression of obsidian
- The goal is to have my note-taking app to be my blog too.

## Obsidian Setup

Plugins I'm using
- [obsidian-git](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git) 
- [obsidian-minimal](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal) theme with [obsidian-minimal-settings](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal-settings) and [obsidian-hider](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-hider)
